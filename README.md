# Hi, I'm Germán Anguiano 👋
I’m a 27-year-old from Mexico with a background in software documentation. This experience gave me a solid understanding of how software systems are designed and structured. I’m currently focused on becoming a full stack developer, building projects and continuously improving my programming skills.
